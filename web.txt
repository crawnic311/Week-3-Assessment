How does the internet work? What happens when you click on a link?

Fundamentally, the internet is composed of individual computers that are connected
together in a network. To improve efficiency and communication, the internet is
now better understood as a network of networks. This means that when I click on a
link from my individual computer at my home, my computer's web browser parses that
link into relavent secitons and uses the data in those sections to get me to where
I'm trying to go on the web.

The http or https is called the internet protocol or IP and it governs how my web 
browser is allowed to send and receive information from other computers.

The www.domainnamehere.com is the domain name which is an alias for the IP address
of the server or servers that host the website I am trying to navigate to. This domain
name is sent by the browser to various DNS services that determine the IP address
associated with the domain name and then connect me with the device of that IP address.

Once a secure and accurate connection has been made the server determines, or has already
determined the port to use to communicate with my personal computer. This is not displayed
in the url.

The path, query, and parameters in the are used to communicate a request from my computer to
the server. The server has software that interprets those requests and responds accordingly.
Assuming everything went well, the server repsonds to me with the data I requested via my 
local computer through my web broswer.
